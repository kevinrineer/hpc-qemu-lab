* TODO Virtual HPC Lab Project Tasks (Network-First Workflow)
** Setup and Prep
   - [X] Ensure host system has required software (Git, QEMU, Ansible) - check_reqs.sh
   - [X] Download Rocky Linux qcow2 cloud image for VM base - download_qcow2.sh

** 172.16.0.0/24 Virtual Networking Setup (Foundation)
   - [ ] Create virtual network bridge or tap interface on host (e.g., br0)
   - [ ] Assign static IP 172.16.0.1 to host bridge as gateway
   - [ ] Configure IP forwarding and firewall rules for isolation and SSH forwarding
   - [ ] Write `setup_network.sh` script to automate bridge creation, IP assignment, tap device setup
   - [ ] Write `teardown_network.sh` script to cleanly dismantle networking environment

** VM Infrastructure Setup (Build on Network)
   - [ ] Prepare image customization (cloud-init or manual config) for initial setup - 
   - [ ] shell scripts launch Central IT VM with network interface on created bridge and static IP
   - [ ] shell scripts launch Storage Node VM similarly with static IP
   - [ ] shell scripts launch Head Node VM similarly with static IP
   - [ ] shell scripts launch Login Node VM similarly with static IP
   - [ ] Launch minimal VMs (Central IT and Head Node) to validate network and VM operation
   - [ ] Expand scripts to launch Login Node VM
   - [ ] Expand scripts to launch Compute Node VMs (support multiple instances)
   - [ ] Implement `start`, `stop`, and `cleanup` commands for whole lab environment in lab.sh

** Foundational step validation
   - [ ] Test VM-to-VM connectivity with basic ping and SSH using placeholder or minimal VMs
   - [ ] Document subnet and IP assignments in README/design notes

** Provisioning (Configure Software Stack)
   - [ ] Create Ansible inventory covering all VMs with their static IPs
   - [ ] Develop Ansible playbooks/roles:
       - Central IT: OpenLDAP server setup
       - Storage Node: NFS server
       - Head Node: Warewulf, Slurm controller
       - Login Node: LDAP client, Slurm worker, NFS mount
   - [ ] Integrate Apptainer container runtime on relevant nodes
   - [ ] Test user authentication via LDAP from all nodes

** Testing and Validation
   - [ ] Verify PXE boot process on compute and login nodes
   - [ ] Test Slurm job scheduling and execution
   - [ ] Validate NFS mounts and file sharing
   - [ ] Confirm containerized workload execution with Apptainer
   - [ ] Verify SSH access and port forwarding works as intended

** Documentation
   - [ ] Update README with step-by-step instructions and architecture overview
   - [ ] Document network design and IP scheme
   - [ ] Include sample job scripts and usage examples
   - [ ] Anything else?

** Optional Enhancements
   - [ ] Make the Login node provisioned by warewulf instead of ansible
   - [ ] Support additional Linux distros?
